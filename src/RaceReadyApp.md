**The Components I Need**

1. Calendar Components (date and time: day, week, month)
2. Logic Component (Date and Time task rank system).
3. Task CRUD Components.
4. Checklist Component.
5. Task Components.
6. Google OAuth sign-in authentication component - Welcome message.
7. MockAPI - User Data.

**The Flow Of My App - What is the Logic**

1. User Pick's a race weekend / Cancel weekend race.
2. Choosing and adding tasks.
3. Approving the task list.
4. CheckList Generated with tasks urgency.
5. Alerts for the undone tasks.

**Core Features**

1. Calendar - Date and Time data. The App Will color the task in specific color related to the current date.
   For example 3 days before the task completion deadline the task will be colored as red. MockApi
2. Choosing Specific Date / Weekend for the race.
3. CRUD - Adding, Updating, Deleting Specific Task from the Default CheckList.
4. Having the Specific race weekend CheckList with the urgency rate of every task.

**2nd Features**

1. The Ability to Delete, edit, mark-as-done task from the CheckList page.
2. The Ability to Save As JPG or Print the Final checklist from a button.
3. Alert the User for a current deadline approach of a task.
4. The App will allow the user to give a 1-5 star rank for the task from important to not important.
   That rand in combination to the date approaching will affect the alert timing, 1 star task will be alerted only 12 hours before the race, 5 star task will be alerted 5 days ahead.
5. Adding Weather API to give the user % of the chance to have rain at the specific date of the race.
6. Splitting the time by seasons of the year so every weekend will have the season of the year mark ( Spring and summer races has more chance of not being canceled by weather).

**Future Features**

1. The App will have a data base to save each user races, login process will be available for registered users.
2. The alerts will be alerted trough Email / WhatsApp and will be more effective.
3. Users can Share Checklist and copy a task from a friend.
4. The App will no longer be a Race Ready App, The App will be open source for the user, He will be able to crate multiple types of tasks on the same calendar (Race task + Work task at the same day with different logic).
